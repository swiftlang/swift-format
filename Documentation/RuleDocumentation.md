### AllPublicDeclarationsHaveDocumentation

All public or open declarations must have a top-level documentation comment.

Lint: If a public declaration is missing a documentation comment, a lint error is raised.

`AllPublicDeclarationsHaveDocumentation` is a linter-only rule.

### AlwaysUseLiteralForEmptyCollectionInit

Never use `[<Type>]()` syntax. In call sites that should be replaced with `[]`,
for initializations use explicit type combined with empty array literal `let _: [<Type>] = []`
Static properties of a type that return that type should not include a reference to their type.

Lint:  Non-literal empty array initialization will yield a lint error.
Format: All invalid use sites would be related with empty literal (with or without explicit type annotation).

`AlwaysUseLiteralForEmptyCollectionInit` rule can format your code automatically.

### AlwaysUseLowerCamelCase

All values should be written in lower camel-case (`lowerCamelCase`).
Underscores (except at the beginning of an identifier) are disallowed.

This rule does not apply to test code, defined as code which:
  * Contains the line `import XCTest`
  * The function is marked with `@Test` attribute

Lint: If an identifier contains underscores or begins with a capital letter, a lint error is
      raised.

`AlwaysUseLowerCamelCase` is a linter-only rule.

### AmbiguousTrailingClosureOverload

Overloads with only a closure argument should not be disambiguated by parameter labels.

Lint: If two overloaded functions with one closure parameter appear in the same scope, a lint
      error is raised.

`AmbiguousTrailingClosureOverload` is a linter-only rule.

### AvoidRetroactiveConformances

`@retroactive` conformances are forbidden.

Lint: Using `@retroactive` results in a lint error.

`AvoidRetroactiveConformances` is a linter-only rule.

### BeginDocumentationCommentWithOneLineSummary

All documentation comments must begin with a one-line summary of the declaration.

Lint: If a comment does not begin with a single-line summary, a lint error is raised.

`BeginDocumentationCommentWithOneLineSummary` is a linter-only rule.

### DoNotUseSemicolons

Semicolons should not be present in Swift code.

Lint: If a semicolon appears anywhere, a lint error is raised.

Format: All semicolons will be replaced with line breaks.

`DoNotUseSemicolons` rule can format your code automatically.

### DontRepeatTypeInStaticProperties

Static properties of a type that return that type should not include a reference to their type.

"Reference to their type" means that the property name includes part, or all, of the type. If
the type contains a namespace (i.e. `UIColor`) the namespace is ignored;
`public class var redColor: UIColor` would trigger this rule.

Lint: Static properties of a type that return that type will yield a lint error.

`DontRepeatTypeInStaticProperties` is a linter-only rule.

### FileScopedDeclarationPrivacy

Declarations at file scope with effective private access should be consistently declared as
either `fileprivate` or `private`, determined by configuration.

Lint: If a file-scoped declaration has formal access opposite to the desired access level in the
      formatter's configuration, a lint error is raised.

Format: File-scoped declarations that have formal access opposite to the desired access level in
        the formatter's configuration will have their access level changed.

`FileScopedDeclarationPrivacy` rule can format your code automatically.

### FullyIndirectEnum

If all cases of an enum are `indirect`, the entire enum should be marked `indirect`.

Lint: If every case of an enum is `indirect`, but the enum itself is not, a lint error is
      raised.

Format: Enums where all cases are `indirect` will be rewritten such that the enum is marked
        `indirect`, and each case is not.

`FullyIndirectEnum` rule can format your code automatically.

### GroupNumericLiterals

Numeric literals should be grouped with `_`s to delimit common separators.

Specifically, decimal numeric literals should be grouped every 3 numbers, hexadecimal every 4,
and binary every 8.

Lint: If a numeric literal is too long and should be grouped, a lint error is raised.

Format: All numeric literals that should be grouped will have `_`s inserted where appropriate.

TODO: Minimum numeric literal length bounds and numeric groupings have been selected arbitrarily;
these could be reevaluated.
TODO: Handle floating point literals.

`GroupNumericLiterals` rule can format your code automatically.

### IdentifiersMustBeASCII

All identifiers must be ASCII.

Lint: If an identifier contains non-ASCII characters, a lint error is raised.

`IdentifiersMustBeASCII` is a linter-only rule.

### NeverForceUnwrap

Force-unwraps are strongly discouraged and must be documented.

This rule does not apply to test code, defined as code which:
  * Contains the line `import XCTest`
  * The function is marked with `@Test` attribute

Lint: If a force unwrap is used, a lint warning is raised.

`NeverForceUnwrap` is a linter-only rule.

### NeverUseForceTry

Force-try (`try!`) is forbidden.

This rule does not apply to test code, defined as code which:
  * Contains the line `import XCTest`
  * The function is marked with `@Test` attribute

Lint: Using `try!` results in a lint error.

TODO: Create exception for NSRegularExpression

`NeverUseForceTry` is a linter-only rule.

### NeverUseImplicitlyUnwrappedOptionals

Implicitly unwrapped optionals (e.g. `var s: String!`) are forbidden.

Certain properties (e.g. `@IBOutlet`) tied to the UI lifecycle are ignored.

This rule does not apply to test code, defined as code which:
  * Contains the line `import XCTest`
  * The function is marked with `@Test` attribute

TODO: Create exceptions for other UI elements (ex: viewDidLoad)

Lint: Declaring a property with an implicitly unwrapped type yields a lint error.

`NeverUseImplicitlyUnwrappedOptionals` is a linter-only rule.

### NoAccessLevelOnExtensionDeclaration

Specifying an access level for an extension declaration is forbidden.

Lint: Specifying an access level for an extension declaration yields a lint error.

Format: The access level is removed from the extension declaration and is added to each
        declaration in the extension; declarations with redundant access levels (e.g.
        `internal`, as that is the default access level) have the explicit access level removed.

`NoAccessLevelOnExtensionDeclaration` rule can format your code automatically.

### NoAssignmentInExpressions

Assignment expressions must be their own statements.

Assignment should not be used in an expression context that expects a `Void` value. For example,
assigning a variable within a `return` statement existing a `Void` function is prohibited.

Lint: If an assignment expression is found in a position other than a standalone statement, a
      lint finding is emitted.

Format: A `return` statement containing an assignment expression is expanded into two separate
        statements.

`NoAssignmentInExpressions` rule can format your code automatically.

### NoBlockComments

Block comments should be avoided in favor of line comments.

Lint: If a block comment appears, a lint error is raised.

`NoBlockComments` is a linter-only rule.

### NoCasesWithOnlyFallthrough

Cases that contain only the `fallthrough` statement are forbidden.

Lint: Cases containing only the `fallthrough` statement yield a lint error.

Format: The fallthrough `case` is added as a prefix to the next case unless the next case is
        `default`; in that case, the fallthrough `case` is deleted.

`NoCasesWithOnlyFallthrough` rule can format your code automatically.

### NoEmptyLinesOpeningClosingBraces

Empty lines are forbidden after opening braces and before closing braces.

Lint: Empty lines after opening braces and before closing braces yield a lint error.

Format: Empty lines after opening braces and before closing braces will be removed.

`NoEmptyLinesOpeningClosingBraces` rule can format your code automatically.

### NoEmptyTrailingClosureParentheses

Function calls with no arguments and a trailing closure should not have empty parentheses.

Lint: If a function call with a trailing closure has an empty argument list with parentheses,
      a lint error is raised.

Format: Empty parentheses in function calls with trailing closures will be removed.

`NoEmptyTrailingClosureParentheses` rule can format your code automatically.

### NoLabelsInCasePatterns

Redundant labels are forbidden in case patterns.

In practice, *all* case pattern labels should be redundant.

Lint: Using a label in a case statement yields a lint error unless the label does not match the
      binding identifier.

Format: Redundant labels in case patterns are removed.

`NoLabelsInCasePatterns` rule can format your code automatically.

### NoLeadingUnderscores

Identifiers in declarations and patterns should not have leading underscores.

This is intended to avoid certain antipatterns; `self.member = member` should be preferred to
`member = _member` and the leading underscore should not be used to signal access level.

This rule intentionally checks only the parameter variable names of a function declaration, not
the parameter labels. It also only checks identifiers at the declaration site, not at usage
sites.

Lint: Declaring an identifier with a leading underscore yields a lint error.

`NoLeadingUnderscores` is a linter-only rule.

### NoParensAroundConditions

Enforces rules around parentheses in conditions or matched expressions.

Parentheses are not used around any condition of an `if`, `guard`, or `while` statement, or
around the matched expression in a `switch` statement.

Lint: If a top-most expression in a `switch`, `if`, `guard`, or `while` statement is surrounded
      by parentheses, and it does not include a function call with a trailing closure, a lint
      error is raised.

Format: Parentheses around such expressions are removed, if they do not cause a parse ambiguity.
        Specifically, parentheses are allowed if and only if the expression contains a function
        call with a trailing closure.

`NoParensAroundConditions` rule can format your code automatically.

### NoPlaygroundLiterals

The playground literals (`#colorLiteral`, `#fileLiteral`, and `#imageLiteral`) are forbidden.

Lint: Using a playground literal will yield a lint error with a suggestion of an API to replace
it.

`NoPlaygroundLiterals` is a linter-only rule.

### NoVoidReturnOnFunctionSignature

Functions that return `()` or `Void` should omit the return signature.

Lint: Function declarations that explicitly return `()` or `Void` will yield a lint error.

Format: Function declarations with explicit returns of `()` or `Void` will have their return
        signature stripped.

`NoVoidReturnOnFunctionSignature` rule can format your code automatically.

### OmitExplicitReturns

Single-expression functions, closures, subscripts can omit `return` statement.

Lint: `func <name>() { return ... }` and similar single expression constructs will yield a lint error.

Format: `func <name>() { return ... }` constructs will be replaced with
        equivalent `func <name>() { ... }` constructs.

`OmitExplicitReturns` rule can format your code automatically.

### OneCasePerLine

Each enum case with associated values or a raw value should appear in its own case declaration.

Lint: If a single `case` declaration declares multiple cases, and any of them have associated
      values or raw values, a lint error is raised.

Format: All case declarations with associated values or raw values will be moved to their own
        case declarations.

`OneCasePerLine` rule can format your code automatically.

### OneVariableDeclarationPerLine

Each variable declaration, with the exception of tuple destructuring, should
declare 1 variable.

Lint: If a variable declaration declares multiple variables, a lint error is
raised.

Format: If a variable declaration declares multiple variables, it will be
split into multiple declarations, each declaring one of the variables, as
long as the result would still be syntactically valid.

`OneVariableDeclarationPerLine` rule can format your code automatically.

### OnlyOneTrailingClosureArgument

Function calls should never mix normal closure arguments and trailing closures.

Lint: If a function call with a trailing closure also contains a non-trailing closure argument,
      a lint error is raised.

`OnlyOneTrailingClosureArgument` is a linter-only rule.

### OrderedImports

Imports must be lexicographically ordered and logically grouped at the top of each source file.
The order of the import groups is 1) regular imports, 2) declaration imports, and 3) @testable
imports. These groups are separated by a single blank line. Blank lines in between the import
declarations are removed.

Lint: If an import appears anywhere other than the beginning of the file it resides in,
      not lexicographically ordered, or  not in the appropriate import group, a lint error is
      raised.

Format: Imports will be reordered and grouped at the top of the file.

`OrderedImports` rule can format your code automatically.

### ReplaceForEachWithForLoop

Replace `forEach` with `for-in` loop unless its argument is a function reference.

Lint:  invalid use of `forEach` yield will yield a lint error.

`ReplaceForEachWithForLoop` is a linter-only rule.

### ReturnVoidInsteadOfEmptyTuple

Return `Void`, not `()`, in signatures.

Note that this rule does *not* apply to function declaration signatures in order to avoid
conflicting with `NoVoidReturnOnFunctionSignature`.

Lint: Returning `()` in a signature yields a lint error.

Format: `-> ()` is replaced with `-> Void`

`ReturnVoidInsteadOfEmptyTuple` rule can format your code automatically.

### TypeNamesShouldBeCapitalized

`struct`, `class`, `enum` and `protocol` declarations should have a capitalized name.

Lint:  Types with un-capitalized names will yield a lint error.

`TypeNamesShouldBeCapitalized` is a linter-only rule.

### UseEarlyExits

Early exits should be used whenever possible.

This means that `if ... else { return/throw/break/continue }` constructs should be replaced by
`guard ... else { return/throw/break/continue }` constructs in order to keep indentation levels
low. Specifically, code of the following form:

```swift
if condition {
  trueBlock
} else {
  falseBlock
  return/throw/break/continue
}
```

will be transformed into:

```swift
guard condition else {
  falseBlock
  return/throw/break/continue
}
trueBlock
```

Lint: `if ... else { return/throw/break/continue }` constructs will yield a lint error.

Format: `if ... else { return/throw/break/continue }` constructs will be replaced with
        equivalent `guard ... else { return/throw/break/continue }` constructs.

`UseEarlyExits` rule can format your code automatically.

### UseExplicitNilCheckInConditions

When checking an optional value for `nil`-ness, prefer writing an explicit `nil` check rather
than binding and immediately discarding the value.

For example, `if let _ = someValue { ... }` is forbidden. Use `if someValue != nil { ... }`
instead.

Lint: `let _ = expr` inside a condition list will yield a lint error.

Format: `let _ = expr` inside a condition list will be replaced by `expr != nil`.

`UseExplicitNilCheckInConditions` rule can format your code automatically.

### UseLetInEveryBoundCaseVariable

Every variable bound in a `case` pattern must have its own `let/var`.

For example, `case let .identifier(x, y)` is forbidden. Use
`case .identifier(let x, let y)` instead.

Lint: `case let .identifier(...)` will yield a lint error.

`UseLetInEveryBoundCaseVariable` is a linter-only rule.

### UseShorthandTypeNames

Shorthand type forms must be used wherever possible.

Lint: Using a non-shorthand form (e.g. `Array<Element>`) yields a lint error unless the long
      form is necessary (e.g. `Array<Element>.Index` cannot be shortened today.)

Format: Where possible, shorthand types replace long form types; e.g. `Array<Element>` is
        converted to `[Element]`.

`UseShorthandTypeNames` rule can format your code automatically.

### UseSingleLinePropertyGetter

Read-only computed properties must use implicit `get` blocks.

Lint: Read-only computed properties with explicit `get` blocks yield a lint error.

Format: Explicit `get` blocks are rendered implicit by removing the `get`.

`UseSingleLinePropertyGetter` rule can format your code automatically.

### UseSynthesizedInitializer

When possible, the synthesized `struct` initializer should be used.

This means the creation of a (non-public) memberwise initializer with the same structure as the
synthesized initializer is forbidden.

Lint: (Non-public) memberwise initializers with the same structure as the synthesized
      initializer will yield a lint error.

`UseSynthesizedInitializer` is a linter-only rule.

### UseTripleSlashForDocumentationComments

Documentation comments must use the `///` form.

This is similar to `NoBlockComments` but is meant to prevent documentation block comments.

Lint: If a doc block comment appears, a lint error is raised.

Format: If a doc block comment appears on its own on a line, or if a doc block comment spans
        multiple lines without appearing on the same line as code, it will be replaced with
        multiple doc line comments.

`UseTripleSlashForDocumentationComments` rule can format your code automatically.

### UseWhereClausesInForLoops

`for` loops that consist of a single `if` statement must use `where` clauses instead.

Lint: `for` loops that consist of a single `if` statement yield a lint error.

Format: `for` loops that consist of a single `if` statement have the conditional of that
        statement factored out to a `where` clause.

`UseWhereClausesInForLoops` rule can format your code automatically.

### ValidateDocumentationComments

Documentation comments must be complete and valid.

"Command + Option + /" in Xcode produces a minimal valid documentation comment.

Lint: Documentation comments that are incomplete (e.g. missing parameter documentation) or
      invalid (uses `Parameters` when there is only one parameter) will yield a lint error.

`ValidateDocumentationComments` is a linter-only rule.
