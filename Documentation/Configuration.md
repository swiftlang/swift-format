# `swift-format` Configuration

`swift-format` allows users to configure a subset of its behavior, both when
used as a command line tool or as an API.

## Command Line Configuration

A `swift-format` configuration file is a JSON file with the following
top-level keys and values:

### `version`  
**type:** number  

**description:** The version of the configuration file. For now, this should always be `1`.  

**default:** `1`  

---

### `lineLength`  
**type:** number  

**description:** The maximum allowed length of a line, in characters.  

**default:** `100`  

---

### `indentation`  
**type:** object  

**description:** The kind and amount of whitespace that should be added when indenting one level. The object value of this property should have exactly one of the following properties:  

- `spaces` _(number)_: One level of indentation is the given number of spaces.  
- `tabs` _(number)_: One level of indentation is the given number of tabs.  

**default:** `{ "spaces": 2 }`  

---

### `tabWidth`  
**type:** number  

**description:** The number of spaces that should be considered equivalent to one tab character. This is used during line length calculations when tabs are used for indentation.  

**default:** `8`  

---

### `maximumBlankLines`  
**type:** number  

**description:** The maximum number of consecutive blank lines that are allowed to be present in a source file. Any number larger than this will be collapsed down to the maximum.  

**default:** `1`  

---

### `spacesBeforeEndOfLineComments`  
**type:** number  

**description:** The number of spaces between the last token on a non-empty line and a line comment starting with `//`.  

**default:** `2`  

---

### `respectsExistingLineBreaks`  
**type:** boolean  

**description:** Indicates whether or not existing line breaks in the source code should be honored (if they are valid according to the style guidelines being enforced). If this settings is `false`, then the formatter will be more "opinionated" by only inserting line breaks where absolutely necessary and removing any others, effectively canonicalizing the output.

**default:** `true`  

---

### `lineBreakBeforeControlFlowKeywords`  
**type:** boolean  

**description:** Determines the line-breaking behavior for control flow keywords that follow a closing brace, like `else` and `catch`. If true, a line break will be added before the keyword, forcing it onto its own line. If `false`, the keyword will be placed after the closing brace (separated by a space).

**default:** `false`  

---

### `lineBreakBeforeEachArgument`  
**type:** boolean  

**description:** Determines the line-breaking behavior for generic arguments and function arguments when a declaration is wrapped onto multiple lines. If true, a line break will be added before each argument, forcing the entire argument list to be laid out vertically. If `false`, arguments will be laid out horizontally first, with line breaks only being fired when the line length would be exceeded.

**default:** `false`  

---

### `lineBreakBeforeEachGenericRequirement`  
**type:** boolean  

**description:** Determines the line-breaking behavior for generic requirements when the requirements list is wrapped onto multiple lines. If true, a line break will be added before each requirement, forcing the entire requirements list to be laid out vertically. If `false`, requirements will be laid out horizontally first, with line breaks only being fired when the line length would be exceeded.

**default:** `false`  

---

### `lineBreakBetweenDeclarationAttributes`  
**type:** boolean  

**description:** Determines the line-breaking behavior for adjacent attributes on declarations. If true, a line break will be added between each attribute, forcing the attribute list to be laid out vertically. If `false`, attributes will be laid out horizontally first, with line breaks only being fired when the line length would be exceeded.

**default:** `false`  

---

### `prioritizeKeepingFunctionOutputTogether`  
**type:** boolean  

**description:** Determines if function-like declaration outputs should be prioritized to be together with the function signature's right (closing) parenthesis. If `false`, function output (i.e. throws, return type) is not prioritized to be together with the signature's right parenthesis, and when the line length would be exceeded, a line break will be fired after the function signature first, indenting the declaration output one additional level. If true, a line break will be fired further up in the function's declaration (e.g. generic parameters, parameters) before breaking on the function's output.  

**default:** `false`  

---

### `indentConditionalCompilationBlocks`  
**type:** boolean  

**description:** Determines if conditional compilation blocks are indented. If this setting is `false` the body of `#if`, `#elseif`, and `#else` is not indented.  

**default:** `true`  

---

### `lineBreakAroundMultilineExpressionChainComponents`  
**type:** boolean  

**description:** Determines whether line breaks should be forced before and after multiline components of dot-chained expressions, such as function calls and subscripts chained together through member access (i.e. "." expressions). When any component is multiline and this option is true, a line break is forced before the "." of the component and after the component's closing delimiter (i.e. right paren, right bracket, right brace, etc.).  

**default:** `false`  

---

## `fileScopedDeclarationPrivacy`
**type:** object

**description:** Declarations at file scope with effective private access should be consistently declared as either `fileprivate` or `private`, determined by configuration.

- `accessLevel` _(string)_: The formal access level to use when encountering a file-scoped declaration with effective private access. Allowed values are `private` and `fileprivate`.

**default:** `{ "accessLevel" : "private" }`  

---

### `indentSwitchCaseLabels`
**type:** boolean

**description:** Determines if `case` statements should be indented compared to the containing `switch` block.

When `false`, the correct form is:
```swift
switch someValue {
case someCase:
  someStatement
...
}
```
When `true`, the correct form is:
```swift
switch someValue {
  case someCase:
    someStatement
  ...
}
```

**default:** `false`

---

### `spacesAroundRangeFormationOperators`  
**type:** boolean  

**description:** Determines whether whitespace should be forced before and after the range formation operators `...` and `..<`.  

**default:** `false`  

---

### `noAssignmentInExpressions`
**type:** object

**description:** Assignment expressions must be their own statements. Assignment should not be used in an expression context that expects a `Void` value. For example, assigning a variable within a `return` statement exiting a `Void` function is prohibited.

- `allowedFunctions` _(strings array)_: A list of function names where assignments are allowed to be embedded in expressions that are passed as parameters to that function.

**default:** `{ "allowedFunctions" : ["XCTAssertNoThrow"] }`

---

### `multiElementCollectionTrailingCommas`  
**type:** boolean  

**description:** Determines whether multi-element collection literals should have trailing commas.  

**default:** `true`  

---

### `reflowMultilineStringLiterals`

> [!NOTE]
> This setting should be specified as a string value (e.g. `"never"`)
> For backward compatibility with swift-format version 601.0.0, the configuration also accepts the legacy object format where the setting is specified as an object with a single key (e.g., ⁠`{ "never": {} }`).

**type:** `string` or `object` (legacy)

**example:**

For all versions above 601.0.0, the configuration should be specified as a string, for example:
```json
{
  "reflowMultilineStringLiterals": "never"
}
```

For version 601.0.0, the configuration should be specified as an object, for example:
```json
{
  "reflowMultilineStringLiterals": {
    "never": {}
  }
}
```

**description:** Determines how multiline string literals should reflow when formatted.

- `never`: Never reflow multiline string literals.
- `onlyLinesOverLength`: Reflow lines in string literal that exceed the maximum line length.
For example with a line length of 10:
```swift
"""
an escape\
 line break
a hard line break
"""
```
will be formatted as:
```swift
"""
an escape\
 line break
a hard \
line break
"""
```
- `always`: Always reflow multiline string literals, this will ignore existing escaped newlines in the literal and reflow each line. Hard linebreaks are still respected.
For example, with a line length of 10:
```swift
"""
one \
word \
a line.
this is too long.
"""
```
will be formatted as:
```swift
"""
one word \
a line.
this is \
too long.
"""
```

**default:** `"never"`

---

### `indentBlankLines`  
**type:** boolean  

**description:** Determines whether blank lines should be modified to match the current indentation. When this setting is true, blank lines will be modified whitespace. If `false`, all whitespace in blank lines will be completely removed.

**default:** `false`

> TODO: Add support for enabling/disabling specific syntax transformations in
> the pipeline.

### Example

An example `.swift-format` configuration file is shown below.

```javascript
{
    "version": 1,
    "lineLength": 100,
    "indentation": {
        "spaces": 2
    },
    "maximumBlankLines": 1,
    "respectsExistingLineBreaks": true,
    "lineBreakBeforeControlFlowKeywords": true,
    "lineBreakBeforeEachArgument": true
}
```

## Linter and Formatter Rules Configuration

In the `rules` block of `.swift-format`, you can specify which rules to apply
when linting and formatting your project. Read the
[rules documentation](RuleDocumentation.md) to see the list of all
supported linter and formatter rules, and their overview.

You can also run this command to see the list of rules in the default
`swift-format` configuration:

    $ swift-format dump-configuration

## API Configuration

The `SwiftConfiguration` module contains a `Configuration` type that is
equivalent to the JSON structure described above. (In fact, `Configuration`
conforms to `Codable` and is how the JSON form is read from and written to
disk.)

The `SwiftFormatter` and `SwiftLinter` APIs in the `SwiftFormat` module take a
mandatory `Configuration` argument that specifies how the formatter should
behave when acting upon source code or syntax trees.

The default initializer for `Configuration` creates a value equivalent to the
default configuration that would be printed by invoking
`swift-format dump-configuration`. API users can also provide their own
configuration by modifying this value or loading it from another source using
Swift's `Codable` APIs.
