/// Types that conform to this protocol can be used as the category of a finding.

/// A finding's category should have a human-readable string representation (by overriding the
/// `description` property from the inherited `CustomStringConvertible` conformance). This is meant
/// to be displayed as part of the diagnostic message when the finding is presented to the user.
/// For example, the category `Indentation` in the message `[Indentation] Indent by 2 spaces`.
public protocol FindingCategorizing: CustomStringConvertible {
  /// The severity of findings emitted in this category.
  ///
  /// By default, all findings are warnings. Individual categories or configuration may choose to override this to
  /// make the findings in those categories more severe.
  var severity: Finding.Severity { get }

  /// The name of the category.
