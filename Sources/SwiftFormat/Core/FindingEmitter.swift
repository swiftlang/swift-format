/// Emits findings encountered during linting or formatting.
///
/// The finding emitter is initialized with an optional consumer function that will be invoked each
/// time a finding is emitted when linting or formatting the syntax tree. This function is expected
/// to act on the finding -- for example, by printing it as a diagnostic to standard error.
///
/// If the consumer function is nil, then the `emit` function is a no-op. This allows callers, such
/// as lint/format rules and the pretty-printer, to emit findings unconditionally, without wrapping
/// each call in a check about whether the client is interested in receiving those findings or not.
final class FindingEmitter {
  /// An optional function that will be called and passed a finding each time one is emitted.
  private let consumer: ((Finding) -> Void)?

  /// Creates a new finding emitter with the given consumer function.
  ///
  /// - Parameter consumer: An optional function that will be called and passed a finding each time
  ///   one is emitted.

  /// Emits a new finding.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - message: A descriptive message about the finding.
  ///   - category: A value that groups the finding into a category.
  ///   - location: The source location where the finding was encountered. In rare cases where the
  ///     finding does not apply to a particular location in the source code, this may be nil.
  ///   - notes: Notes that provide additional detail about the finding, possibly referring to other
  ///     related locations in the source file.
