  /// false, then this break will only produce a line break when absolutely necessary (i.e., if the

  /// An example use of a `continue` break is when an expression is split across multiple lines;
  /// the break before each operator is a continuation:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// let someLongVariable = someLongExpression

  /// base indentation level instead of an increased continuation level.

  /// comma-delimited list:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// let array = [
  ///   1, 2, 3,
  ///   4, 5, 6,
  ///   7, 8, 9,
  /// ]
  /// ```
  case same

  /// A `reset` break that occurs on a continuation line forces a line break that ends the
  /// continuation and causes the tokens on the next line to be indented at the base indentation
  /// level.
  ///
  /// These breaks are used, for example, to force an open curly brace onto a new line if it would
  /// otherwise fit on a continuation line, so that the body of the braced block can be
  /// distinguished from the continuation line(s) above it:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// func foo(_ x: Int) {
  ///   // This is allowed because the line above is not a continuation.
  /// }
  ///
  /// func foo(
  ///   _ x: Int
  /// ) {
  ///   // This is also allowed, for the same reason.
  /// }
  ///
  /// func foo(_ x: Int)
  ///   throws -> Int
  /// {
  ///   // Here we must force the brace down or the block contents would
  ///   // collide with the "throws" line.
  /// }

  /// first child `contextualBreakingStart`/`contextualBreakingEnd` pair. When the first child is
  /// multiline the contextual breaks maintain indentation and they are continuations otherwise.
  ///
  /// These are used when multiple related breaks need to exhibit the same behavior based the
  /// context in which they appear. For example, when breaks exist between expressions that are
